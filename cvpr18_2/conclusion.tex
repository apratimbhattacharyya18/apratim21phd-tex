We highlight the importance of anticipation for practical and safe driving  in inner cities. We contribute to this important research direction the first model for long term prediction of pedestrians from on-board observations. We show  predictions over a time horizon of 1 second. Predictions of our model are enriched by theoretically grounded uncertainty estimates. Key to our success is a Bayesian approach and long term prediction of odometry. We evaluate and compare several different architecture choices and arrive at a novel two-stream Bayesian LSTM encoder-decoder.
