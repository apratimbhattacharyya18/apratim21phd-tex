%We are interested in fine-grained activity recognition for which we have created the dataset introduced above. 
To better understand the state-of-the-art for the challenging task of fine-grained activity recognition we benchmark two approaches on our new dataset. 
The first 
(\secref{sec:cvpr12:approach:pose}) uses features derived from an upper body model motivated by the intuition that human body configurations and human body motion should provide strong cues for activity recognition in general but particularly for fine-grained activity recognition. 
The second (\secref{sec:cvpr12:approach:holistic}) is a state-of-the-art method~\citep{wang11cvpr,wang13ijcv} that has shown promising results on various datasets.
